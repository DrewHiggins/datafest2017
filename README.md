Penn State DataFest 2017
========================

This a collection of data and files used to generate a Sankey graph and interactive map diagram for Penn State's 2017 DataFest competition, made with Google Charts, jQuery, a JS Map-Reduce framework (which was definitely not implemented in the most efficient or proper way) and R (for subsetting the data).

The files in here are messy and were thrown together in a hurry with little to no regard to best practices or reuse, as they were thrown together over the course of about 8 hours. Also, the data sets have been stripped out in order to comply with the requests of the ASA that these datasets remain confidential, which is also why I haven't described them.

The end result contributed to our overall winning team, with the wonderfully punny name: Ψ-lent but Deadly (I understand that the greek letter Ψ is not heavily used in statistics, but it was the first greek letter joke we thought of).
